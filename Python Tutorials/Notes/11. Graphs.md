# Graphs in DSA (python)
---
- There are nodes and edges similar to Tree DS
- graphs can be directed and non-directed.
- The edges can be weighted and non-weighted.
  
- It is different from a Tree DS as there can be any number of connections between 2 nodes 
- There can be multiple paths between nodes (not there in tree DS)

- IRL examples of graph usage : 
  - Google maps
  - Amazon recommendations
  - internet 
  - facebook (social media apps)
  
- Graphs are implemented generally using a hash map (or a dictionary in python)
- Each source node is a key in the graph
- It's corresponding values is a adjacency list containing all the nodes we can go to from that key node 

There are 2 ways to perform traversal in graph :
1. DFS - uses stack as a DS
2. BFS - uses queue as a DS
