# Trees Data Structure in Python 
---

## Introduction 
- Trees are DS which are used to represent the **Hierarchical data**.
- For example ,the previous DS which we have seen (arrays, lists, stacks, queues) cannot be used to represent data which is like this : 
![Image](./Notes%20Assets/hierarchical%20data.png)
- This data is in Hierarchical form. 
- The "Electronic" node is the `root` of the tree 
- The node without any children are called `leaf` nodes
- The Tree is divided into different levels
![Image](./Notes%20Assets/levels%20of%20tree.png)
- The parent nodes which come before a node are called it's `ancestors`
- The children nodes which are below a node are called it's `descendants`
- Another good use case of tree DS is in folder structure
