## Storing information using variables
Computers are useful for two purposes: storing information (also known as data) and performing operations on stored data. While working with a programming language such as Python, data is stored in variables. You can think of variables are containers for storing data. The data stored within a variable is called its value. Creating variables in Python is pretty easy.
```
my_favorite_color = "blue"
print(my_favorite_color)        # prints blue
```
- A variable is created using an assignment statement. It begins with the variable's name, followed by the assignment operator `=` followed by the value to be stored within the variable.  Note that the assignment operator `=` is different from the equality comparison operator `==`.
- You can also assign values to multiple variables in a single statement by separating the variable names and values with commas.
```
color1, color2, color3 = "red", "green", "blue"
```
You can assign the same value to multiple variables by chaining multiple assignment operations within a single statement.
```
color4 = color5 = color6 = "magenta"
```
You can change the value stored within a variable by assigning a new value to it using another assignment statement. Be careful while reassigning variables: when you assign a new value to the variable, the old value is lost and no longer accessible.
```
my_favorite_color = "red"
```
While reassigning a variable, you can also use the variable's previous value to compute the new value.
```
counter = 10
counter = counter + 1
print(counter)      # prints 11
```
The pattern `var = var op something` (where `op` is an arithmetic operator like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) is very common, so Python provides a *shorthand* syntax for it.
```
# Same as `counter = counter + 4`
counter += 4
```
Variable names can be short (`a`, `x`, `y`, etc.) or descriptive ( `my_favorite_color`, `profit_margin`, `the_3_musketeers`, etc.). However, you must follow these rules while naming Python variables:

* A variable's name must start with a letter or the underscore character `_`. It cannot begin with a number.
* A variable name can only contain lowercase (small) or uppercase (capital) letters, digits, or underscores (`a`-`z`, `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, and `_`).
* Variable names are case-sensitive, i.e., `a_variable`, `A_Variable`, and `A_VARIABLE` are all different variables.

## Built-in data types in Python

Any data or information stored within a Python variable has a *type*. You can view the type of data stored within a variable using the `type` function.
```
type(a_variable)
```
Python has several built-in data types for storing different kinds of information in variables. Following are some commonly used `data types`:

1. Integer
2. Float
3. Boolean
4. None
5. String
6. List
7. Tuple
8. Dictionary

`Integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `None`, and `string` are *primitive data types* because they represent a single value. Other data types like `list`, `tuple`, and `dictionary` are often called *data structures* or *containers* because they hold multiple pieces of data together.

---
### Integer

Integers represent positive or negative whole numbers, from negative infinity to infinity. Note that integers should not include decimal points. Integers have the type `int`.
Unlike some other programming languages, integers in Python can be arbitrarily large (or small). There's no lowest or highest value for integers, and there's just one `int` type (as opposed to `short`, `int`, `long`, `long long`, `unsigned int`, etc. in C/C++/Java).

---

### Float

Floats (or floating-point numbers) are numbers with a decimal point. There are no limits on the value or the number of digits before or after the decimal point. Floating-point numbers have the type `float`.
`Note` that a whole number is treated as a `float` if written with a decimal point, even though the decimal portion of the number is zero.
Floating point numbers can also be written using the scientific notation with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
```
one_hundredth = 1e-2        # 1/100
Speed_Of_Light = 3e+8        # 3x10^8
```
You can convert floats into integers and vice versa using the `float` and `int` functions. The operation of converting one type of value into another is called casting (type casting).
`Syntax` : datatype_we_want(variable) eg :
```
float( intNum )     # converts int to float
int( floatNum )     # rounds off float to nearest int

```
While performing arithmetic operations, integers are automatically converted to `float`s if any of the operands is a `float`. Also, the division operator `/` always returns a `float`, even if both operands are integers. Use the `//` operator if you want the result of the division to be an `int`.
```
type(45 * 3.0)      # float 
type(45 * 3)        # int
type(10/3)          # float
type(10/2)          # float
type(10//2)         # int
```

---

### Boolean

Booleans represent one of 2 values: `True` and `False`. Booleans have the type `bool`.
Booleans are generally the result of a comparison operation, e.g., `==`, `>=`, etc.
```
cost_of_ice_bag = 1.25
is_ice_bag_expensive = cost_of_ice_bag >= 10
print(is_ice_bag_expensive)                     # false
type(is_ice_bag_expensive)                      # bool
```
Booleans are automatically converted to `int` when used in arithmetic operations. `True` is converted to `1` and `False` is converted to `0`.
```
5 + False       # gives 5 
3. + True       # gives 4.0
```

Any value in Python can be converted to a Boolean using the `bool` function. 

Only the following values evaluate to `False` (they are often called ***falsy*** values):

1. The value `False` itself
2. The integer `0`
3. The float `0.0`
4. The empty value `None`
5. The empty text `""`
6. The empty list `[]`
7. The empty tuple `()`
8. The empty dictionary `{}`
9. The empty set `set()`
10. The empty range `range(0)`

Everything else evaluates to `True` (a value that evaluates to `True` is often called a ***truthy*** value).

---

### String

A string is used to represent text (*a string of characters*) in Python. Strings must be surrounded using quotations (either the single quote `'` or the double quote `"`). Strings have the type `string`.

Note that special characters like `\n` and escaped characters like `\"` count as a single character, even though they are written and sometimes printed as two characters.

A string can be converted into a list of characters using `list` function.
```
multiline_string = """a
b"""
print(multiline_string)     # prints a\nb
list(multiline_string)
print(multiline_string)     # prints ['a','\n','b']
```
Strings also support several list operations, which are discussed in the next section. We'll look at a couple of examples here.

You can access individual characters within a string using the `[]` indexing notation. Note the character indices go from `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the string.

You can access a part of a string using by providing a `start:end` range instead of a single index in `[]`.
```
toady = 'Saturday'
today[5:8]                  # day
```

You can also check whether a string contains a some text using the `in` operator. 
```
print('day' in today)       # true
print('Sun' in today)       # false
```
Two or more strings can be joined or *concatenated* using the `+` operator. Be careful while concatenating strings, sometimes you may need to add a space character `" "` between words.

Strings in Python have many built-in *methods* that are used to manipulate them. Let's try out some common string methods.

> **Methods**: Methods are functions associated with data types and are accessed using the `.` notation e.g. `variable_name.method()` or `"a string".method()`. Methods are a powerful technique for associating common operations with values of specific data types.

The `.lower()`, `.upper()` and `.capitalize()` methods are used to change the case of the characters.
```
today.lower()               # saturday
today.upper()               # SATURDAY
"monday".capitalize()       # Monday
```

The `.replace` method replaces a part of the string with another string. It takes the portion to be replaced and the replacement text as *inputs* or *arguments*.
```
another_day = today.replace("Satur", "Wednes")
print(another_day)          # Wednesday
```
**Note** that `replace` returns a new string, and the original string is not modified.

The `.split()` method splits a string into a list of strings at every occurrence of provided character(s).
```
days_of_week = "Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat".split(",")
print(days_of_week) # ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
```
The `.strip()` method removes whitespace characters from the beginning and end of a string.
```
a_long_line = "       This is a long line with some space before, after,     and some space in the middle..    "
a_long_line_stripped = a_long_line.strip()
print(a_long_line_stripped)     # 'This is a long line with some space before, after,     and some space in the middle..'
```

You can `str` to convert a value of any data type into a string.
```
str(23)                     # '23'
str(23.432)                 # '23.432'
str(True)                   # 'True'

the_3_musketeers = ["Athos", "Porthos", "Aramis"]
str(the_3_musketeers)       # "['Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis']"
```

Note that all string methods return new values and DO NOT change the existing string. You can find a full list of string methods [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp). 

Strings also support the comparison operators `==` and `!=` for checking whether two strings are equal.
```
first_name = "John"
first_name == "Doe"         # False
first_name == "John"        # True
first_name != "Jane"        # True
```

We've looked at the `primitive` data types in Python. We're now ready to explore `non-primitive` data structures, also known as `containers`.

### List

A list in Python is an ordered collection of values. Lists can hold values of different data types and support operations to add, remove, and change values. Lists have the type `list`.

To create a list, enclose a sequence of values within square brackets `[` and `]`, separated by commas.
```
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
type(fruits)                # list
```
Let's try creating a list containing values of different data types, including another list.
```
a_list = [23, 'hello', None, 3.14, fruits, 3 <= 5]
print(a_list)               # [23, 'hello', None, 3.14, ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], True]
```

To determine the number of values in a list, use the `len` function. You can use `len`  to determine the number of values in several other data types (Eg:String).
```
print("Number of fruits:", len(fruits))
print("Number of a_list:",len(a_list))
```
You can access an element from the list using its *index*, e.g., `fruits[2]` returns the element at index 2 within the list `fruits`. (The starting index of a list is 0).
You can use negative indices to access elements from the end of a list, e.g., `fruits[-1]` returns the last element, `fruits[-2]` returns the second last element, and so on.
```
fruits[1]       # 'banana'
fruits[-1]      # 'cherry'
fruits[-2]      # 'banana'
```
You can also access a `range` of values from the list. The result is itself a list. Let us look at some examples.
```
a_list[2:5]     # [None, 3.14, ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']]
```
Note that the range `2:5` includes the element at the start index `2` but does not include the element at the end index `5`. So, the result has 3 values (index `2`, `3`, and `4`).
This is because starting indexes are inclusive and ending indexes are exclusive in python for almost all the methods.
You can also change the value at a specific index within a list using the `assignment` operation.
```
fruits[1] = 'blueberry'
```
A new value can be added to the end of a list using the `append()` method.
```
fruits.append('dates')
print(fruits)               # ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'dates']
```
A new value can also be inserted at a specific index using the `insert` method.
```
fruits.insert(1, 'banana')
print(fruits)               # ['apple', 'banana', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'dates']
```

You can remove a value from a list using the `remove` method.
```
fruits.remove('blueberry')
print(frutis)               # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'dates']
```
**Note** the `.remove()` method will only remove the first occurrence of the element passed if the list contains multi occurrences of the same element

To remove an element from a specific index, use the `pop()` method. The method also returns the removed element.
```
fruits              # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'dates']
fruits.pop(1)       # returns the popped item : 'banana'
print(fruits)       # ['apple', 'cherry', 'dates']
fruits.pop()        # if no idx mentioned, the last element is popped
print(fruits)       # ['apple', 'cherry']
```

You can test whether a list contains a value using the `in` operator.
```
'pineapple' in fruits       # False
'cherry' in fruits          # True
```

To combine two or more lists, use the `+` operator. This operation is also called *concatenation*.
```
more_fruits = fruits + ['pineapple', 'tomato', 'guava'] + ['dates', 'banana']
```

To create a copy of a list, use the `copy` method. Modifying the copied list does not affect the original.
```
more_fruits_copy = more_fruits.copy()
```
Note that you cannot create a copy of a list by simply creating a new variable using the assignment operator `=`. **The new variable will point to the same list, and any modifications performed using either variable will affect the other**.

Just like strings, there are several `in-built` methods to manipulate a list. However, unlike strings, **most list methods modify the original list** rather than returning a new one. Check out some common list operations [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp).

### Tuple

A tuple is an ordered collection of values, similar to a list. However, it is not possible to add, remove, or modify values in a tuple. A tuple is created by enclosing values within parentheses `(` and `)`, separated by commas.

> Any data structure that cannot be modified after creation is called *immutable*. You can think of tuples as immutable lists.
```
fruits = ('apple', 'cherry', 'dates')
print(len(fruits))                          # 3
print(fruits[0])                            # 'apple'
print(fruits[-2])                           # 'cherry'
print('dates' in fruits)                    # True

fruits[0] = 'avocado'                       # Will Cause an error
fruits.append('blueberry')                  # Will Cause an error
fruits.remove('apple')                      # Will Cause an error

```

You can also skip the parantheses `(` and `)` while creating a tuple. Python automatically converts comma-separated values into a tuple.
```
the_3_musketeers = 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis' 
print(the_3_musketeers)                     # ('Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis')
```
You can also create a `tuple` with just one element by typing a comma after it. Just wrapping it with parentheses `(` and `)` won't make it a tuple.
```
single_element_tuple = 4,                   # (4,)
another_single_element_tuple = (4,)         # (4,)
not_a_tuple = (4)                           # taken as just 4 
```

Tuples are often used to create multiple variables with a single statement.
```
point = (3, 4)
point_x, point_y = point
point_x                                     # 3
point_y                                     # 4
```

You can convert a list into a tuple using the `tuple` function, and vice versa using the `list` function
```
tuple(['one', 'two', 'three'])              # ('one', 'two', 'three')
list(('Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis'))        # ['Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis']
```
Tuples have just two built-in methods: `count` and `index`. Can you figure out what they do?
```
a_tuple = 23, "hello", False, None, 23, 37, "hello"
print(a_tuple.count('hello'))               # 2 - counted the number of occurrence of element
print(a_tuple.index(None))                  # 3 - index of passed element
```
---

### Dictionary

A dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item stored in a dictionary has a key and value. You can use a key to retrieve the corresponding value from the dictionary.  Dictionaries have the type `dict`.

Dictionaries are often used to store many pieces of information e.g. details about a person, in a single variable. Dictionaries are created by enclosing key-value pairs within braces or curly brackets `{` and `}`.
```
person1 = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'sex': 'Male',
    'age': 32,
    'married': True
}

print(person1)              # {'name': 'John Doe', 'sex': 'Male', 'age': 32, 'married': True}
```
Dictionaries can also be created using the `dict` function.
```
person2 = dict(name='Jane Judy', sex='Female', age=28, married=False)
print(peron2)               # {'name': 'Jane Judy', 'sex': 'Female', 'age': 28, 'married': False}
print(type(person2))        # dict
```
Keys can be used to access values using square brackets `[` and `]`.
```
person1['name']             # 'John Doe'
person1['married']          # True
person2['name']             # 'Jane Judy'
person1['addr']             # If a key isn't present in the dictionary, then a KeyError is thrown.
```
You can also use the `get` method to access the value associated with a key.
```
person2.get("name")         # 'Jane Judy'
```
The `get` method also accepts a default value, returned if the key is not present in the dictionary.
```
person2.get("address", "Unknown")       # 'Unknown'
```
You can check whether a key is present in a dictionary using the `in` operator.
```
'name' in person1           # True
'address' in person1        # False
```
You can change the value associated with a key using the assignment operator (`=`).
```
person2['married']          # False
person2['married'] = True
person2['married']          # True
```
The assignment operator can also be used to `add` new key-value pairs to the dictionary.
```
person1['address'] = '1, Penny Lane'
# {'name': 'John Doe', 'sex': 'Male', 'age': 32, 'married': True, 'address':'1, Penny Lane'}
```
To remove a key and the associated value from a dictionary, use the `pop()` method.
```
person1.pop('address')      # returns the popped item - '1, Penny Lane'
print(person1)
# {'name': 'John Doe', 'sex': 'Male', 'age': 32, 'married': True}
```
Dictionaries also provide methods to view the list of `keys`, `values`, or `key-value pairs` inside it.
```
person1.keys()              # dict_keys(['name', 'sex', 'age', 'married'])
person1.values()            # dict_values(['John Doe', 'Male', 32, True]
person1.items()             # dict_items([('name', 'John Doe'), ('sex', 'Male'), ('age', 32), ('married', True)])
```
The results of `keys`, `values`, and `items` look like lists. However, they don't support the indexing operator `[]` for retrieving elements. 

Can you figure out how to access an element at a specific index from these results?
```
list_of_keys = list(p1.keys())
list_of_values = list(p1.values())
list_of_key_val_pairs = list(p1.items())
```
Now these are proper `lists` and are **iterable**
