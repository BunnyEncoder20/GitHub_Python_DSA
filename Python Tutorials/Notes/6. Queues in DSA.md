# Queues in DSA (python) 
---

## Introduction
- Queues are used in things like Producer-consumer problem where one entity is producing and consumer is consuming the info but their rates of doing so are not same.
- In such a situation, we use a Queue in between these two so that there is no loss of data    
- Queues pretty much work the exact same way as real life queues. Who is in front of the line will get teh service / chance first

## Implementation of Queue in Python

1. we can implement a simple **queue** using `list` in python
```
simpleQ = []

# inserting elements 
simpleQ.insert(0, 132)
simpleQ.insert(0, 135)
simpleQ.insert(0, 140)

print(simpleQ)

# popping elements 
print(simpleQ.pop())
print(simpleQ.pop())
```
- **NOTE** remember that `.insert(idx,data)` function of list is used to add _data_ into a specific _idx_ of the list. So when we _insert_ a new element into the queue, all the previous elements are pushed forward (towards the right) to make space for the new element. 
- This way the list behaves like a queue using **FIFO**
- But again , this implementation of queue will suffer from the same drawbacks of dynamic array (when they grow in size)
- Hence this is not the recommended way of implementing queue in python
- Instead we use `collection.deque()` to implement the Queue
- Remember, `deque` DS in python is a doubly ended queue itself
```
from collections import deque
queue = deque()

queue.appendleft(132)   # appends to left of the deque (which is regarded as the back of the queue)
queue.appendleft(135)
queue.appendleft(140)

print(queue)            # deque([140, 135, 132]) 

queue.pop()             # 132
queue.pop()             # 135
```

    def enqueue(self, data):
        self.buffer.appendleft(data)
        print("{} added into queue".format(data))
    
    def dequeue(self):
        popped = self.buffer.pop()
        print("{} exited queue".format(popped))
        return popped
    
    def nextInLine(self):
        return self.buffer[-1]
    
    def isEmpty(self):
        return len(self.buffer)==0
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.buffer)
    
    def show(self):
        print(self.buffer)

Q = Queue()

print(Q.isEmpty())

Q.enqueue(1)
Q.enqueue(2)
Q.enqueue(3)
Q.enqueue(4)

Q.show()

Q.dequeue()
Q.dequeue()

print("Next in line : ",Q.nextInLine())

Q.show()
```
