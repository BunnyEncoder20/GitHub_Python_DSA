# Binary Search Trees in DSA (Python)
---

## Python data type : Set 
- a set object is a collection of unique (distinct) elements 
- They are similar to lists , but do not contain duplicates
- Eg : 
```python
countriesList = ["USA","India","USA","India","China"]
print(countriesList)                # ['USA', 'India', 'USA', 'India', 'China']
countriesSet = set(countriesList)
print(countriesSet)                 # {'USA', 'China', 'India'}
```
- Internally, we can use a Binary Search Tree to implement a set

## Binary Search Trees (BST)

- **Binary Trees** is just a general tree with the constraint that every node can have only 2 children.
- Also all the nodes of the BT are unique
- **Binary Search Trees** is a special case of Binary Trees in which the elements hae some kind of order. 
- Eg : In the below example, all the elements in the left of the Node are smaller than the Node number and all the elements in the right side are greater than the node number.

- Is ordering of the elements is useful when we want to search for some element in the BST.
- Eg : We want to Get to 14 element 
  - from root because 14 < 15 we go towards the LSH
  - from 12 node, because 14 > 12 we go RHS
  - we find our element
- This reduces the search space by half every time we go down a level. 

### Complexities
- **Time Complexity** for search in BST : `O(Log n)`
- **Time Complexity** for inserting in BST : `O(Log n)`

### Traversal Techniques
1. BFS
2. DFS
    >- In order traversal (root node **IN** middle of traversal)
    >- Pre order traversal (root node **Pre** traversal : root node first >> left >> right )
    >- Post order traversal (root node **Post** traversal : left >> right >> root node last)

## HW question 
```
1. find_min(): finds minimum element in entire binary tree
2. find max(): finds maximum element in entire binary tree
3. calculate_sum(): calculates sum of all elements
4. post_order_traversal(): performs post order traversal of BT
5. pre_order_traversal(): perform pre order traversal of BT
```
