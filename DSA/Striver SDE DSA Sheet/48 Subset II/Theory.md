# Subset Sum II - Print all Unique subsets

- Given an array of integers that may contain duplicates the task is to return all possible subsets. Return only unique subsets and they can be in any order.

## Brute Force Approach 

### Algorithm 

- We use the same recursive method of picking and not picking an element
- Then we will feed each of the List states (subsets) into a set to avoid duplicates 
- Finally we will convert the set elements into a list and return them.


### Code 

```python

```
- Time complexity : O()
