# Data Structures 

- **Data structures** (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently.
- They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
- They make code cleaner and easier to understand. 
- They can be the difference between a good and an excellent project (SDE)

## Abstract Data Types 

- An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of data structures which provides only the interface to which a Data structure must adhere to 
- The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language
- Examples : 

| **Abstraction (ADT)** 	|                   **Implementation (DS)**                   	|
|:---------------------:	|:-----------------------------------------------------------:	|
|         List          	|                  Dynamic Array Linked List                  	|
|         Queue         	| Linked List based Queue Array based Queue Stack based Queue 	|
|          Map          	|                Tree Map Hash map / Hash table               	|
|        Vehicle        	|                 Golf Cart  Bicycle Smart Car                	| 

## Static vs Dynamic Arrays 

- A static array is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n - 1].

## 1. Lists (Arrays)

## 2. Linked Lists 

## 3. HashMaps

## 4. Trees 

## 5. Sorting 

## 6. Searching
